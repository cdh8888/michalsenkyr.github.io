Hello, everyone, and welcome to my first blog.

## About me

I am a software engineer currently working in [Seznam.cz](https://seznam.cz) on the [Sklik](https://sklik.cz/) advertising platform. My job is to design and implement processes which consume the massive amounts of data that Seznam.cz collects via its fulltext search solution as well as its partner network.

I also recently started contributing to the [Apache Spark](https://github.com/apache/spark) project during my free time.


## Motivation

As part of my work on the various technologies, Big Data or otherwise, I am continually acquiring new knowledge in the field. Sadly, a lot of this knowledge necessitates wading through a lot of documentation, other blog posts, forum threads, source code, etc. As I already have some experience in explaining difficult to grasp concepts (I already lead lectures for my colleagues), I decided to also put it down in writing. My hope is that through this effort I might be able to assist people in understanding the wonderful technologies I am working with.

At the same time I would like to use this opportunity to brush up on my active English communication skills.

## Content

The list of topics that I plan to cover on this blog:

* Scala programming &amp; libraries
* Big Data technologies ([Spark](https://spark.apache.org), [Flink](https://flink.apache.org), [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org), etc.)
* Advanced Java programming &amp; libraries (esp. involving functional paradigms)
* Other interesting technologies I found myself working with (like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), which is used by this blog)
* Important events in my life, esp. if they would affect my work - I will try to keep these at a minimum

## Contact

Feel free to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/michalsenkyr), [GitHub](https://github.com/michalsenkyr) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/michalsenkyr). I will also try to actively respond to comments on posts on this blog.

I will be happy for any feedback or suggestion you might have regarding my articles as well as recommendations of interesting technologies or procedures that you'd like to bring to my attention.

Enjoy!
