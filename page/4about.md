## Summary

I am a strong proponent of the Scala programming language and a Big Data enthusiast. I have extensive knowledge of many technologies relating to the Java/Scala ecosystem and I am always open to learn more. I love building new systems from the ground up and watching them evolve. I have some perfectionist tendencies when it comes to software I produce and I am able to refactor and rebuild my code repeatedly for days until I find the perfect equilibrium of performance and maintainability, however I also understand project time constrains and the need to follow a set timeline and I can plan accordingly. I abhor badly structured code, the absence of proper testing procedures, inefficient policies and, above all else, repetition. However, I also understand that these tend to come from inexperience which I gladly combat with tutoring, lectures and courses as I like to pass on my knowledge to others.
